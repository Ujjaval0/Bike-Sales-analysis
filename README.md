🚲 Bike Sales Dashboard – Excel Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a bike sales dataset in Excel to understand who buys bikes and why.
The goal was to clean the raw data, build an interactive sales dashboard, and translate the numbers into clear business insights for stakeholders.
​

🎯 Objective
Identify the ideal customer profile for bike purchases.
​

Understand how age, income, occupation, commute distance, car ownership, and region influence bike buying behavior.
​

Present the findings through an interactive Excel dashboard and a concise strategic insight report.

​

📊 Key Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning & Preparation

Standardized age groups, income formats, and region names.

Checked for duplicates and obvious data errors.

Ensured fields were ready for pivot‑based analysis.
​

Exploratory Analysis

Used filters and sorting to explore trends by age, income, occupation, commute distance, cars, and region.

Built pivot tables to compare buyers vs non‑buyers across multiple dimensions.
​

Dashboard Creation

Converted important pivot tables into charts.

Combined visuals into a single, structured Excel dashboard.

Added slicers for dynamic exploration by stakeholders.
​

Insight Generation

Highlighted middle‑aged customers as the core buyer segment.

Showed that short commutes and low car ownership are strong signals for bike purchase.

Summarized findings and recommendations in a stakeholder‑friendly presentation.
​

🧠 Key Insights
Age: Middle‑aged customers (31–54) drive most bike purchases.
​

Income: Buyers earn more on average than non‑buyers, with a practical threshold around $50k–$60k.
​

Occupation: Professionals and skilled workers are the top buyer segments.
​

Commute Distance: Short commutes (0–5 miles) correlate with higher purchase rates; demand drops sharply beyond 10 miles.
​

Car Ownership: Fewer cars (0–1) → higher likelihood of buying; 3+ cars → bike becomes a low‑priority luxury.
​

Region: North America leads by volume, while Europe shows strong conversion supported by bike‑friendly culture.
