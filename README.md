# 🚲 Bike Sales Dashboard – Excel Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing a bike sales dataset in Excel to understand **who buys bikes and why**.  
The goal was to clean the raw data, build an interactive sales dashboard, and translate the numbers into clear business insights for stakeholders.

## 🎯 Objective  
- Identify the **ideal customer profile** for bike purchases.  
- Understand how **age, income, occupation, commute distance, car ownership, and region** influence bike buying behavior.  
- Present the findings through an **interactive Excel dashboard** and a concise **strategic insight report**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used  

**Excel Features & Functions**
- Data cleaning (remove noise, fix categories, standardize formats)  
- Sorting, filtering, and custom filters  
- Data Validation (dropdowns, controlled inputs)  
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts  
- Slicers for interactive filtering  
- Conditional formatting to highlight key patterns  
- Lookup and analysis formulas (e.g. `XLOOKUP`, basic aggregate calculations)

**Data Transformation**
- **Power Query Editor** for:
  - Importing raw data  
  - Renaming and typing columns  
  - Handling missing and inconsistent values  
  - Creating clean tables ready for analysis  

**Dashboard & Reporting**
- Designed an **Excel dashboard** with:
  - Purchases by age group, income, occupation and region  
  - Commute distance vs bike buying behavior  
  - Car ownership vs purchase likelihood  
- Created a **Strategic Sales Analysis Report (PPT)** summarizing:
  - Ideal customer profile

## 📊 Key Analysis Steps  

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Standardized age groups, income formats, and region names.  
   - Checked for duplicates and obvious errors.  
   - Ensured all fields were usable for pivot analysis.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Used filters and sorting to quickly explore trends.  
   - Built pivot tables to study:
     - Purchase vs non‑purchase by age, income, gender, marital status, and education.  
     - Impact of commute distance and car ownership.  
     - Regional differences.

3. **Dashboard Creation**  
   - Converted key pivot tables into charts.  
   - Arranged visuals into a single dashboard view.  
   - Added slicers to allow stakeholders to slice data by key dimensions.

4. **Insight Generation**  
   - Identified the core buyer: **middle‑aged, urban professional, ~\$60k+ income, 0–1 cars, 0–5 mile commute**.  
   - Highlighted commute distance and car ownership as the **strongest predictors** of purchasing.  
   - Summarized insights and recommendations in a presentation.

## 🧠 Key Insights  

- **Age:** Middle‑aged customers (31–54) drive the majority of bike purchases.  
- **Income:** Buyers earn more on average than non‑buyers, with a practical threshold around **\$50k–\$60k**.  
- **Occupation:** Professionals and skilled workers are the top buyer segments.  
- **Commute Distance:** Short commutes (0–5 miles) strongly correlate with higher purchase rates; demand drops sharply beyond 10 miles.  
- **Car Ownership:** Fewer cars (0–1) → higher likelihood of buying a bike; 3+ cars → bike becomes a low‑priority luxury.  
- **Region:** North America leads by volume, while Europe shows strong conversion due to bike‑friendly culture.
